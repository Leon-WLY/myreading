1
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:30,808
Soon she will be born.

2
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:49,800
He would be a powerful Orc.

3
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:57,944
You will have offspring.

4
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:01,837
It's all thanks to you.

5
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:07,886
You will have a friend for practice.

6
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:46,777
There will be no one
can stop our war group.

7
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:06,845
Our enemies will die.

8
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:15,811
She said what?

9
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:22,957
- He asked forgiveness for his son.
- Ignore him.

10
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:54,992
Magic of Gul'dan.

11
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:10,893
Fuel for my magic is life threatening.
You are the strongest warrior.

12
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:26,783
When we arrive, we will
take our enemies as fuel.

13
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:35,934
And we will bring
destruction to them all.

14
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:37,878
Let me go first.

15
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:48,017
You're carrying a baby
in my battle group?

16
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:12,843
Poor woman.

17
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:53,977
The new knight for Horde.

18
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:24,978
Come here, I have something for you.

19
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:37,797
- What is wrong?
- Miracle mechanic.

20
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:50,806
Read this.

21
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:03,806
Go home. Someone will come.

22
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:30,876
- We found something.
- Are you from there?

23
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:34,879
Healthy.

24
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:39,984
You are there?

25
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:53,762
What are you doing here?

26
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:08,911
- Let me finish this.
- No one can do that.

27
00:12:28,863 --> 00:12:36,975
- What's that?
- Guardian.

28
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:45,791
Call the king and the Guardian.

29
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:16,814
What kind of wild thing to do that?

30
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:26,926
- Release him.
- Honourable.

31
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:41,009
- What is it, a witch?
- I want to be Guardian of the year.

32
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:44,881
Who wants to carry you?

33
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:53,725
I have an ability.

34
00:13:54,015 --> 00:14:02,833
There are dark forces are very
close, we can not ignore it.

35
00:14:02,957 --> 00:14:06,905
- Take him away.
- Good, sir.

36
00:14:09,764 --> 00:14:12,745
Your Excellency, call the Guardian.

37
00:14:18,873 --> 00:14:19,977
What is wrong?

38
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:27,823
- What?
- Maybe he's right.

39
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,790
- Dad will not believe.
- My son does not need your help.

40
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:36,768
I was the queen.

41
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:42,007
And also my sister.

42
00:14:44,766 --> 00:14:49,010
How long since that time?

43
00:14:49,771 --> 00:14:55,881
- 6 years?
- No contact at all.

44
00:14:56,878 --> 00:15:01,952
- No need to start now.
- Guardian calling.

45
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:46,933
- All was subdued.
- Respect our honor.

46
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:57,042
Do not kill too many,
we need them alive.

47
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:11,820
- Lothar.
- Karos.

48
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:25,927
Many things have changed.

49
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:30,930
- Where is he?
- I did not know there was this many books.

50
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:43,820
Do not touch anything.

51
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:51,928
Glad to see you, Lothar.
Guardian need your help.

52
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:58,936
He could not resist you.

53
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:37,940
- You called him?
- No.

54
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:49,886
- What are you doing?
- I make sculptures.

55
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:56,887
It took a long time without magic.

56
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:05,769
- Have a drink.
- Thank you.

57
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:14,862
Glad to see you. I brought this.

58
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:32,887
Hello? Who are you?

59
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:37,022
- What are you doing?
- Guardian, do not.

60
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:45,790
I do not mean all sorts.

61
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:49,967
- Let me explain.
- Explain what?

62
00:20:55,968 --> 00:21:00,849
I'm a researcher.

63
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:09,814
Many secret knowledge in this place.

64
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:16,994
The great strength that can
be catastrophic for Azeroth.

65
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,869
I'm doing the right thing.

66
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:06,780
- Honourable.
- It's been a long time.

67
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,923
During this time there
was never a problem.

68
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:23,922
- What is this?
- There is a team.

69
00:22:23,923 --> 00:22:28,929
A monster that can not be stopped.
Many who have been affected.

70
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:35,968
- We have to get ready.
- We do not know anything about them.

71
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:40,942
We need information.

72
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:50,952
We must protect this government.

73
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:55,926
I was the Guardian, it is my duty.

74
00:22:57,022 --> 00:23:03,997
- Yes you're right. Who is he?
- Sorry, Your Honor.

75
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:08,742
What do you think?

76
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:15,979
Starting from there.

77
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:30,387
Guardian.

78
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,396
Alert!

79
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:17,333
Guardian!

80
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:45,305
Do not be afraid of them.

81
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:50,276
You have to be smart.

82
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:15,298
- What are you doing?
- I have to go back.

83
00:27:16,388 --> 00:27:16,999
Good luck.

84
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,199
- Where Guardian?
- He's back.

85
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:24,142
- Di mana kudamu
-? Mereka mengambil kudaku.

86
00:27:24,168 --> 00:27:26,239
Hold it right there.

87
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:10,051
Do not come close.

88
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:13,858
I will kill him.

89
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:25,997
He scares me.

90
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,689
Right here!

91
00:29:54,726 --> 00:30:00,699
Can you spell? As Guardian.

92
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:20,659
Creature are you? Why
did you attack our land?

93
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,925
- He does not understand a word you're saying.
- You can speak our language?

94
00:31:01,298 --> 00:31:03,278
You got a name?

95
00:31:06,337 --> 00:31:08,408
You understand our language.

96
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:14,512
Once again, you have a name?

97
00:31:20,484 --> 00:31:25,490
Garona. Day menyebut
dirinya sendiri Garonne.

98
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:33,435
- What the hell are you?
- A wild creature.

99
00:31:33,464 --> 00:31:39,278
- Orc.
- Orc? That's you?

100
00:31:40,373 --> 00:31:44,321
I know all the races in the Seven
Kingdoms. I've never heard of orcs.

101
00:31:46,512 --> 00:31:48,514
Show me where you come from.

102
00:31:55,254 --> 00:32:02,229
That's not our world.

103
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:07,241
Not of this world? I do not understand.

104
00:32:08,434 --> 00:32:14,510
- We got a magic gate.
- How did you get the language we?

105
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:22,517
- From some prisoners of war.
- Our people? They are still alive?

106
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:26,394
Why?

107
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:33,271
- They will be fuel.
- Sacrificing them?

108
00:32:34,261 --> 00:32:40,405
- No.
- That is a crime.

109
00:32:45,305 --> 00:32:51,256
Children Orc...

110
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:56,388
We do not want war. We just
want to protect our people.

111
00:32:57,384 --> 00:33:02,527
If you help us, I promise
you'll get your baby back.

112
00:33:15,302 --> 00:33:20,445
You have to let a small
team kill kesatriamu.

113
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:27,281
You're embarrassing your people.

114
00:33:27,448 --> 00:33:31,297
Orc Horde need not weak.

115
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:35,802
Care about our tradition, war lords.

116
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:44,845
You know what to do.

117
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:11,031
- Why do you bother her?
- We fight hard.

118
00:34:11,897 --> 00:34:18,815
- Why are you mengkhanati our people?
- Only I can control you.

119
00:34:22,975 --> 00:34:27,975
Blackhand might make you weak.

120
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:50,478
Do not mess with death, Gul'dan.

121
00:34:51,274 --> 00:34:54,346
The price is worth it.

122
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:09,428
You want to hold your son?

123
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:33,429
- He'll be a leader.
- In contrast to today.

124
00:35:39,426 --> 00:35:41,428
You challenged her.

125
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:50,245
Gul'dan bring destruction to us.

126
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:58,490
- Whatever will be.
- Whatever will be.

127
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,398
What is wrong?

128
00:36:16,263 --> 00:36:22,339
I'm curious about Gul'dan.

129
00:36:23,504 --> 00:36:27,475
- What do you want to know?
- You've seen it.

130
00:36:28,342 --> 00:36:34,520
Full of fire and ash.

131
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:51,376
They're here.

132
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:11,494
A waitress? I could kill you with ease.

133
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:22,276
He is my brother. The
king is my husband.

134
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:27,506
- You are the wife of the leader of the tribe?
- I think so.

135
00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:33,478
- Kill you will bring honor.
- Not among my people.

136
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:39,486
It's a cold night. I
think you'll need this.

137
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:50,301
It will make you feel warm.

138
00:38:00,207 --> 00:38:02,278
Another of our village on fire tonight.

139
00:38:05,112 --> 00:38:07,114
The village where I was born.

140
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:11,889
I can not imagine the
horror that you can carry.

141
00:38:12,922 --> 00:38:15,869
But this need not happen.

142
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:18,872
It has been many years
there was peace in the land

143
00:38:19,028 --> 00:38:22,066
Peace between different
races from around the world.

144
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:30,941
What is this?

145
00:38:35,044 --> 00:38:36,955
I can pull it out.

146
00:38:40,115 --> 00:38:43,927
There is life here for you, Garona.

147
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:49,959
Life with freedom.
That is, if you want it.

148
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,752
He made a gate.

149
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:15,715
"Darkness came true."
That's pretty awful.

150
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:41,582
Glad I could see trees
again. And also the snow.

151
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:44,620
Even from a distance.

152
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:49,696
Remember when we were
there in the first forest?

153
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:57,439
There is always a life.

154
00:39:57,464 --> 00:39:59,705
We lost our house when
Gul'dan authorities.

155
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:04,538
- One Orc can not do that.
- Are you sure?

156
00:40:04,704 --> 00:40:09,585
Look around you. It does
not remind you of anything?

157
00:40:16,683 --> 00:40:21,598
We all need to respect life, my friend.

158
00:40:22,491 --> 00:40:24,493
Gul'dan must be stopped.

159
00:40:26,628 --> 00:40:30,542
We are not strong
enough to defeat Gul'dan.

160
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:42,484
But with the help of
humans, we can do it.

161
00:40:55,557 --> 00:40:56,729
I want it.

162
00:41:01,463 --> 00:41:04,706
- This is to protect you.
- I do not need anyone to protect me.

163
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,544
See what are you?

164
00:41:49,578 --> 00:41:52,457
You watch first.

165
00:41:52,481 --> 00:41:57,484
- My name is Khadgar.
- Sorry, Khadgar.

166
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:02,491
I think we've got a bond.
I've released you from prison.

167
00:42:03,492 --> 00:42:04,630
I try to keep ahead.

168
00:42:21,507 --> 00:42:24,647
At least you do not read.

169
00:42:28,514 --> 00:42:33,657
- What is your problem with me?
- What?

170
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:38,532
- Did you hurt yourself?
- I do not want to lie.

171
00:42:38,567 --> 00:42:41,562
Well done.

172
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:43,562
Why are you laughing?

173
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:49,476
You humans could survive without
big muscles to protect you?

174
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:53,515
- You easily broken bones.
- It's not important to us.

175
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:58,454
- How can you survive?
- Broken bones heal and become stronger.

176
00:42:59,478 --> 00:43:01,515
Strong man.

177
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:07,687
- Sorry.
- No need.

178
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:18,669
My name, Garona, meaning "hard worker."

179
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:26,482
My mother was burned alive
because of giving birth.

180
00:43:31,577 --> 00:43:35,650
- But they do not kill you.
- As a slave.

181
00:43:38,584 --> 00:43:43,624
They gave us the task
to deliver the Orcs.

182
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,704
My parents gave me the Kerathor
others when I was 6 years old.

183
00:43:56,501 --> 00:44:02,452
Together with my brothers and sisters.

184
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:08,715
Give children in Kerathor
bring honor to the family.

185
00:44:09,548 --> 00:44:12,482
Give their son floated into town

186
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:15,555
and trained by the most
powerful wizards in the region.

187
00:44:17,556 --> 00:44:19,729
I had wanted to run.

188
00:44:28,463 --> 00:44:32,570
It was really a fun story.

189
00:44:35,536 --> 00:44:36,674
Large gate.

190
00:44:39,707 --> 00:44:44,554
- Why do they need a lot of prisoners?
- They are wood for the fire.

191
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,551
To keep the gate open.

192
00:44:48,516 --> 00:44:50,553
How much more do they want to bring?

193
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:53,589
All. They are a group of war.

194
00:44:54,522 --> 00:44:58,561
When the portal is open,
they will keep coming.

195
00:45:05,566 --> 00:45:09,639
Send word to Stormwind.

196
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,723
Garona, we have to go.
Here it is not safe.

197
00:45:23,685 --> 00:45:28,725
- Durotan.
- There is a black stone that touches the sky.

198
00:45:29,657 --> 00:45:33,537
- I want to meet with their leaders.
- What?

199
00:45:33,628 --> 00:45:38,702
I saw you with them.
You know what they do.

200
00:45:39,634 --> 00:45:43,707
And you know what is done
by Gul'dan to my people.

201
00:45:43,738 --> 00:45:48,483
His death.

202
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:51,554
He must be stopped.

203
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:57,688
Tell them, Blackrock, as the
sun reaches its highest point.

204
00:45:58,586 --> 00:45:59,587
OK.

205
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:09,631
Chieftain, when I go
back, can I join your clan?

206
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:14,439
You're safe here.

207
00:47:07,584 --> 00:47:13,660
- There is trouble everywhere.
- Then do not go anymore.

208
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:18,640
They are now in urgent need Guardian.

209
00:47:19,696 --> 00:47:22,472
Maybe the boy can help.

210
00:47:27,538 --> 00:47:29,711
- That's the solution.
- Easy for you to say.

211
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,728
- Fort Dwan 'to work overtime.
- Can not.

212
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:37,716
- We will not supply you anymore.
- Enough!

213
00:47:39,516 --> 00:47:43,521
You all been called to Stormwind before.

214
00:47:44,521 --> 00:47:49,664
If we do not unite to fight
this enemy, we will be destroyed.

215
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:59,678
- This is your war, not our war.
- Honourable.

216
00:48:00,702 --> 00:48:01,635
Commander.

217
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,708
The orcs built a portal
to carry the team.

218
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:08,611
If we do not stop them now, we
probably will not get the chance again.

219
00:48:09,478 --> 00:48:13,517
Where is she? Where the
protection of Azeroth?

220
00:48:13,552 --> 00:48:15,586
- Where the Guardian?
- Where is he?

221
00:48:16,618 --> 00:48:20,566
- We pause for a moment.
- Take breaks as long as possible.

222
00:48:20,601 --> 00:48:21,590
We're done.

223
00:48:27,596 --> 00:48:30,475
We've been taking care of what is left.

224
00:48:30,499 --> 00:48:33,673
- The remaining?
- Callan was among them.

225
00:48:42,609 --> 00:48:43,679
Father?

226
00:48:49,749 --> 00:48:51,558
I am fine.

227
00:48:54,554 --> 00:48:56,465
You made me worry.

228
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:03,664
- Where's the rest of your troops?
- They took all alive.

229
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:09,546
- Everything.
- Calm down.

230
00:49:14,674 --> 00:49:15,675
You're alive.

231
00:49:20,446 --> 00:49:21,516
I'm a warrior.

232
00:49:30,657 --> 00:49:34,662
He will not ask for a meeting if
he thought could beat Gul'dan alone.

233
00:49:38,663 --> 00:49:41,701
- He must have scared her.
- He can not do anything.

234
00:49:41,736 --> 00:49:43,474
Loca...

235
00:49:45,469 --> 00:49:46,675
Meeting this sudden...

236
00:49:49,473 --> 00:49:50,679
- As a trap.
- Not.

237
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:53,097
- Can be.
- Not.

238
00:49:53,132 --> 00:49:55,486
What do you think?

239
00:49:56,447 --> 00:49:57,687
This opportunity is
too good to be ignored.

240
00:49:58,482 --> 00:49:59,722
I guess we have no choice.

241
00:50:01,552 --> 00:50:04,499
We must stop the orcs open portal.

242
00:50:05,523 --> 00:50:06,627
But we will need help.

243
00:50:07,525 --> 00:50:09,505
- What if he's lying?
- Orc do not lie.

244
00:50:09,527 --> 00:50:11,598
- What if he's lying?
- That's dishonorable actions.

245
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,509
Similarly, rather than
betray their own kind?

246
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:20,479
Durotan protect his
clan. The sell is Gul'dan.

247
00:50:20,571 --> 00:50:24,519
How do you know Durotan?

248
00:50:24,542 --> 00:50:27,648
He was freed and he
is loved by his clan.

249
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:32,689
- He is a strong leader.
- He won the trust of his clan.

250
00:50:34,518 --> 00:50:36,498
You should join us.

251
00:50:37,688 --> 00:50:39,599
It's a sign.

252
00:50:49,465 --> 00:50:50,739
To protect yourself.

253
00:50:53,469 --> 00:50:55,608
- With this?
- Yes.

254
00:50:57,606 --> 00:50:58,710
Search the Guardian.

255
00:51:01,744 --> 00:51:05,692
What is this?

256
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:14,533
I've seen it and collect clues.

257
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:19,571
- Do you copy this file from?
- Guardian.

258
00:51:19,695 --> 00:51:21,641
And this?

259
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:26,620
And this, this...

260
00:51:26,655 --> 00:51:29,575
I researched...

261
00:51:29,605 --> 00:51:35,453
I am the Guardian. I, not him.

262
00:51:35,644 --> 00:51:37,715
I thought you would want to help.

263
00:51:46,689 --> 00:51:51,729
Do not think. You can help.

264
00:51:52,695 --> 00:51:54,538
I could use you.

265
00:51:55,731 --> 00:52:03,479
If you want to help protect
the king, leave all to me.

266
00:52:17,517 --> 00:52:19,622
- An interesting selection.
- Guardian.

267
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,653
I need your help. I found the book.

268
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:47,522
There is an illustration
showing on the gate.

269
00:52:51,685 --> 00:52:56,430
We can trace it.

270
00:52:56,456 --> 00:52:58,697
There is a hidden way to get there.

271
00:53:07,465 --> 00:53:09,467
U-turn.

272
00:53:11,669 --> 00:53:12,704
See?

273
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:19,488
What do you think the Orcs call?

274
00:53:19,611 --> 00:53:22,524
You can find it there.

275
00:53:26,684 --> 00:53:28,664
Guardian burn your research results?

276
00:53:32,457 --> 00:53:36,496
He's just trying to protect you.

277
00:53:54,446 --> 00:53:56,551
Get ready for a surprise attack.

278
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:04,499
- The spies are already in place.
- Good.

279
00:55:08,618 --> 00:55:10,723
I am the King Llane.

280
00:55:10,753 --> 00:55:13,529
I hear you want to talk.

281
00:55:18,594 --> 00:55:20,733
Ask them when they plan to return?

282
00:55:30,506 --> 00:55:31,610
Our world is destroyed.

283
00:55:34,477 --> 00:55:35,510
There is no home anymore for us.

284
00:55:35,545 --> 00:55:38,492
We are not responsible for
the destruction of your home.

285
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:40,584
War will not solve anything.

286
00:55:48,457 --> 00:55:50,733
He says for the Orcs,
war solve everything.

287
00:55:54,562 --> 00:55:55,666
And why is he here?

288
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:02,547
To save my people.

289
00:56:04,505 --> 00:56:07,543
Stopping again spilled more lives.

290
00:56:08,676 --> 00:56:11,657
There is something
that makes them corrupt.

291
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:15,694
Poison everything with magic.

292
00:56:16,617 --> 00:56:21,498
It all had to be destroyed
so that my people can be safe.

293
00:56:23,691 --> 00:56:28,538
There are people that we capture.

294
00:56:29,597 --> 00:56:31,543
He uses them as a
sacrifice to the portal.

295
00:56:32,566 --> 00:56:36,708
You have to attack our
camp and drove them out.

296
00:56:38,606 --> 00:56:42,486
Otherwise they will die.

297
00:56:44,478 --> 00:56:45,548
Two days.

298
00:56:47,715 --> 00:56:52,630
If we do this, protect them until then.

299
00:56:55,689 --> 00:56:57,566
I've been trying.

300
00:57:01,495 --> 00:57:02,667
Trap!

301
00:57:08,736 --> 00:57:12,445
Orc, protect our camp!

302
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:49,612
Focus.

303
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:14,476
Come on!

304
00:58:25,612 --> 00:58:27,489
Look out!

305
00:58:28,482 --> 00:58:29,654
You are okay?

306
00:58:32,486 --> 00:58:34,523
Quickly find the others, quickly!

307
00:58:34,555 --> 00:58:36,432
I'll pick the other.

308
00:58:38,459 --> 00:58:39,597
We'll get out of here.

309
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,504
He will cover our tracks.

310
00:59:08,622 --> 00:59:10,568
This must end.

311
00:59:16,563 --> 00:59:18,668
- Protect him.
- Good.

312
00:59:34,548 --> 00:59:37,586
Formation shield!

313
00:59:55,702 --> 00:59:57,648
No.

314
00:59:59,473 --> 01:00:00,645
Feel.

315
01:00:02,709 --> 01:00:04,620
All.

316
01:00:10,584 --> 01:00:12,495
Feel.

317
01:00:20,627 --> 01:00:22,607
Kill them all!

318
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:38,590
Retreat to the castle!

319
01:00:53,694 --> 01:00:55,640
See.

320
01:01:01,602 --> 01:01:03,479
Nice.

321
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:09,453
Look out!

322
01:01:20,587 --> 01:01:22,430
Medivh!

323
01:01:27,594 --> 01:01:29,471
Son of man.

324
01:01:35,469 --> 01:01:36,675
Shoot.

325
01:01:37,704 --> 01:01:39,547
Medivh!

326
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,523
Where is she?

327
01:03:31,551 --> 01:03:32,723
He's here!

328
01:03:37,457 --> 01:03:39,624
- She's hurt.
- We have to take him.

329
01:03:39,659 --> 01:03:42,435
- I'll take the horse.
- You're not going to get when riding a horse.

330
01:03:42,562 --> 01:03:44,473
Bawa kudaku.

331
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,586
Put him in front of the fireplace.

332
01:03:57,644 --> 01:04:01,524
- No. He's what?
- I've told him not to leave the place.

333
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,479
- We need help, now.
- Go.

334
01:04:23,503 --> 01:04:25,676
There are drugs that should I prepare.

335
01:04:30,444 --> 01:04:32,651
You and this baby had to leave, now.

336
01:04:35,582 --> 01:04:37,721
You're a traitor, Durotan.

337
01:04:38,652 --> 01:04:42,691
No. I appreciate our first who.

338
01:04:42,722 --> 01:04:46,425
- As you used to do.
- It is over.

339
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:50,670
- Now the situation is different.
- There is still hope.

340
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,676
Our children.

341
01:05:02,542 --> 01:05:05,489
Do not make me take his life.

342
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:07,659
You're the leader.

343
01:05:08,717 --> 01:05:10,663
Give me advice.

344
01:05:12,588 --> 01:05:14,693
Will you miss people?

345
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:27,572
See our children.

346
01:05:32,641 --> 01:05:34,552
Now go.

347
01:05:50,692 --> 01:05:52,535
You.

348
01:05:52,594 --> 01:05:54,574
Where is that person?

349
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:57,410
He told me to take care of you.

350
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,544
- You come.
- You're alive.

351
01:06:02,573 --> 01:06:04,553
Lothar son died.

352
01:06:08,746 --> 01:06:11,488
Because I.

353
01:06:13,517 --> 01:06:16,691
- Lothar will hate me.
- And that makes you sad.

354
01:06:20,624 --> 01:06:22,661
He was a great soldier.

355
01:06:24,495 --> 01:06:28,534
- It is known to people.
- As Orc.

356
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:31,635
I'm not an Orc.

357
01:06:33,637 --> 01:06:35,708
I'm also not human.

358
01:06:38,742 --> 01:06:43,714
When I was young I never felt it.

359
01:06:44,548 --> 01:06:47,688
I was traveling to distant places.

360
01:06:47,718 --> 01:06:49,698
Searching...

361
01:06:50,588 --> 01:06:56,698
Wisdom, and few relationships
with people who look after.

362
01:06:58,462 --> 01:07:02,604
In my travels, I meet people
who are strong, and honorable.

363
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:08,706
Among them was a woman who accept me.

364
01:07:09,573 --> 01:07:11,553
Who loved me.

365
01:07:14,478 --> 01:07:19,552
There was a time I lived happily.

366
01:07:20,551 --> 01:07:22,456
If the love that you need...

367
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:25,627
... You must be willing
to end the world.

368
01:07:32,498 --> 01:07:35,502
- Do you have it?
- No.

369
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:00,432
I saved this for you.

370
01:08:09,602 --> 01:08:10,603
This...

371
01:08:11,737 --> 01:08:13,648
It's my gift to you.

372
01:08:14,473 --> 01:08:15,611
Come on.

373
01:08:44,539 --> 01:08:47,520
All exchange for dummies.

374
01:08:48,476 --> 01:08:50,649
Strange creatures.

375
01:08:53,514 --> 01:08:58,520
- We also.
- You are mahuk terrible.

376
01:08:59,487 --> 01:09:02,661
We are from the south
already know about you.

377
01:09:09,497 --> 01:09:14,469
Remember that joins us.

378
01:09:14,635 --> 01:09:17,548
You give them a failure.

379
01:09:17,705 --> 01:09:21,448
- All of them.
- Durotan would not agree with all of this.

380
01:09:21,483 --> 01:09:24,480
And why do you care what
she thought was a traitor?

381
01:09:25,446 --> 01:09:28,518
Your son is the leader of the clan.

382
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:31,687
He's got his own desires.

383
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,524
When you appreciate it.

384
01:09:38,659 --> 01:09:40,570
Now...

385
01:09:41,629 --> 01:09:43,575
Come here.

386
01:09:43,698 --> 01:09:46,508
I will give you strength.

387
01:09:48,436 --> 01:09:53,545
They will poison first.

388
01:09:54,442 --> 01:09:57,651
Then we arrest them, bring them here.

389
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:01,683
I will stand in front
of them, let them see...

390
01:10:01,749 --> 01:10:04,628
How strong I am now.

391
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,624
As I said, people are practical.

392
01:10:09,659 --> 01:10:14,506
It's a new beginning. Time permitting.

393
01:10:15,532 --> 01:10:19,708
Breathe in the air, just you.

394
01:10:33,616 --> 01:10:35,596
Forgive me.

395
01:10:37,687 --> 01:10:39,633
Nothing.

396
01:10:41,558 --> 01:10:43,663
It has happened.

397
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:50,704
I long abused his right.

398
01:10:52,469 --> 01:10:54,506
I will not blame you.

399
01:11:04,581 --> 01:11:06,492
I was very young.

400
01:11:06,549 --> 01:11:08,529
Come here.

401
01:11:16,495 --> 01:11:18,532
My entire life...

402
01:11:21,566 --> 01:11:25,480
I've never felt pain like now.

403
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,627
- Street!
- We have to hurry.

404
01:11:45,657 --> 01:11:47,728
Burn them!

405
01:11:53,465 --> 01:11:55,706
Quick!

406
01:12:12,651 --> 01:12:17,691
- I'll be a blood bath with you.
- Maybe, but not now.

407
01:12:17,726 --> 01:12:21,694
Go if you want, I can
not give anything more.

408
01:12:22,661 --> 01:12:26,632
For the good of your children, Draka...

409
01:12:26,698 --> 01:12:29,702
Go on, now.

410
01:12:43,517 --> 01:12:47,659
They should not trust you
as a leader of the orcs.

411
01:13:25,461 --> 01:13:26,735
Fast.

412
01:13:27,563 --> 01:13:30,544
Khadgar, how dare you come here!

413
01:13:30,566 --> 01:13:32,705
- Exit!
- I'm here to seek your wisdom.

414
01:13:32,735 --> 01:13:37,480
- But now there is nothing for you here.
- The guard was ill.

415
01:13:37,506 --> 01:13:40,544
- What?
- He was poisoned by them.

416
01:13:40,576 --> 01:13:42,578
Ridiculous.

417
01:13:42,611 --> 01:13:45,717
- What do you know about the portal of darkness?
- You're back,

418
01:13:46,482 --> 01:13:48,758
- And accuses...
- Where is he?

419
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:01,565
- Thats it.
- What's that

420
01:14:02,498 --> 01:14:05,707
The shape of the current lack of them.

421
01:14:06,602 --> 01:14:09,640
You think he's just like a guard?

422
01:14:10,506 --> 01:14:12,486
Protects.

423
01:14:12,574 --> 01:14:17,489
No one knows about its existence beyond
the console, and it will stay that way.

424
01:14:18,447 --> 01:14:22,623
And you mention the time
portal near darkness.

425
01:14:30,559 --> 01:14:34,598
- What did he do?
- I do not know, he never melalkukan it before.

426
01:14:53,682 --> 01:14:58,563
- Khadgar.
- I know you, from the library.

427
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:02,624
You Aloman?

428
01:15:03,694 --> 01:15:09,474
I put the rest of
kekutanku to call here.

429
01:15:09,667 --> 01:15:13,615
- Guards have betrayed us.
- How do you know?

430
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:18,682
- I see the evil in his eyes.
- He dominated.

431
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:23,546
If he is not stopped,
the world will burn.

432
01:15:23,581 --> 01:15:26,460
I did not have the
strength to beat the keeper.

433
01:15:27,485 --> 01:15:29,590
The guard is just a name.

434
01:15:30,454 --> 01:15:34,698
Actual guards of this world
are human beings themselves.

435
01:15:35,459 --> 01:15:38,497
I know you see what
they can do and can not.

436
01:15:38,629 --> 01:15:42,668
That's why you left them. Nothing...

437
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,579
Could stand against the darkness.

438
01:15:46,637 --> 01:15:48,480
Alone.

439
01:15:48,572 --> 01:15:51,485
I do not know what you want me to do.

440
01:15:52,678 --> 01:15:54,715
Yes, you know.

441
01:15:58,518 --> 01:16:00,555
Believe in your friends.

442
01:16:01,521 --> 01:16:04,502
Together, you can save this duia.

443
01:16:04,624 --> 01:16:07,434
Always remember...

444
01:16:07,593 --> 01:16:09,732
Light comes from the darkness...

445
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:12,532
And of darkness...

446
01:16:25,678 --> 01:16:27,555
Come on.

447
01:16:34,453 --> 01:16:36,660
thanks.

448
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:41,561
You'll be a keeper.

449
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:46,632
thanks.

450
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,537
For all you have done.

451
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:07,722
What happened?

452
01:17:09,589 --> 01:17:14,561
Looks like I've let the
orcs into this world.

453
01:17:14,694 --> 01:17:18,699
The feeling was strange.

454
01:17:18,731 --> 01:17:21,474
I do not even know what I've done.

455
01:17:21,502 --> 01:17:24,676
I just do not remember.

456
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:32,715
All that I protect, had I...

457
01:17:33,681 --> 01:17:35,718
Destroy.

458
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:38,723
I can not control this.

459
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:44,626
No one can.

460
01:17:56,604 --> 01:17:59,551
5 legion to close this road.

461
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:03,647
10 again here, and
here, on the mountain.

462
01:18:04,545 --> 01:18:08,387
Supplies here. While
the eastern sea here.

463
01:18:08,485 --> 01:18:11,694
If we are in this position, we are
in a state of the most powerful.

464
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:15,635
- Can not.
- You got a better choice?

465
01:18:15,659 --> 01:18:17,639
Their people more 10 times.

466
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:20,508
How?

467
01:18:21,631 --> 01:18:25,670
- To be honest it's not easy. - Our
primary goal is not to let them kemari-

468
01:18:26,603 --> 01:18:30,517
If we fail, a matter of
time before they beat us.

469
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:32,520
What are your suggestions?

470
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:35,485
Send all that we got.

471
01:18:35,745 --> 01:18:39,648
Destroy them, and end
as soon as possible.

472
01:18:39,683 --> 01:18:44,496
- And Orcs left? - We take care of it
later. - Until they dominate the government?

473
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:47,702
- Your Highness.
- Medivh, you came.

474
01:18:47,724 --> 01:18:51,467
Yes. I feel...

475
01:18:51,661 --> 01:18:54,540
- Filled back.
- We need you.

476
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:58,512
We consider our options, some
believe that there is no choice.

477
01:18:58,535 --> 01:19:00,640
- We need advice.
- And I have.

478
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:04,514
- I've met Durotan.
- You met Durotan.

479
01:19:04,549 --> 01:19:08,455
And Gul'dan gathered strength.

480
01:19:08,545 --> 01:19:12,550
- With their help we can destroy this gate.
- That does not change my plans.

481
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:16,530
- What plan?
- Anduin believe we have to attack with full force.

482
01:19:16,619 --> 01:19:19,498
I'm afraid it will make the
government had no defense.

483
01:19:19,522 --> 01:19:22,662
How many legions do you
need to defeat the orcs?

484
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:27,704
5 in this place, in the mountains
10, 10 again to protect the city.

485
01:19:27,739 --> 01:19:30,498
We've lost 18 legion.

486
01:19:30,533 --> 01:19:34,447
- At least 1, 2, 3.
- It can be done.

487
01:19:34,471 --> 01:19:36,576
No, it could not be done.

488
01:19:37,674 --> 01:19:41,713
- With 3 legion, under my power...
- With all due respect,

489
01:19:41,748 --> 01:19:44,555
bus not expected.

490
01:19:45,482 --> 01:19:49,624
- I've made you disappointed?
- Where have you been diving 6 years?

491
01:19:51,521 --> 01:19:54,730
- Please, Anduin. Medivh is a keeper.
- Not as you remember.

492
01:19:55,725 --> 01:20:00,572
He is unstable, and he will not
be there when you really need them.

493
01:20:00,663 --> 01:20:04,634
- Keep your words, Anduin.
- I did it for you.

494
01:20:04,734 --> 01:20:09,683
If I see there is a small chance
to win, but this was a suicide.

495
01:20:10,507 --> 01:20:12,612
It's about Gul'dan?

496
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:15,410
It was a tragedy.

497
01:20:15,445 --> 01:20:19,414
So far to win approval...

498
01:20:19,449 --> 01:20:22,555
- You did not know.
- He already knows that.

499
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:25,623
And you let him play as a soldier...

500
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:29,424
You killed him!

501
01:20:29,459 --> 01:20:33,703
- Calm down.
- Take him to the cells to cool down.

502
01:20:35,465 --> 01:20:37,536
First you do not like this.

503
01:20:47,546 --> 01:20:50,459
I will protect the government.

504
01:20:50,615 --> 01:20:52,561
You want action?

505
01:21:05,464 --> 01:21:08,502
- Why are you here?
- King...

506
01:21:09,568 --> 01:21:11,639
He will fight.

507
01:21:13,538 --> 01:21:17,486
With the release guardian,
Durotan would kill Gul'dan...

508
01:21:17,509 --> 01:21:19,533
- Do not trust him.
- I told you,

509
01:21:19,568 --> 01:21:21,558
- Orc will not lie.
- Not really.

510
01:21:25,517 --> 01:21:27,554
Do not believe Medhiv.

511
01:21:31,656 --> 01:21:34,500
I will try to protect your king.

512
01:21:34,626 --> 01:21:36,606
Do not go with him.

513
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:38,472
Why?

514
01:21:40,599 --> 01:21:42,601
I do not want you to get hurt.

515
01:21:56,648 --> 01:21:58,685
And come back alive.

516
01:22:21,606 --> 01:22:23,677
Hey, walk everywhere!

517
01:22:26,678 --> 01:22:29,098
Now there is a new enemy.

518
01:22:29,133 --> 01:22:31,518
I thought it was you.

519
01:22:45,530 --> 01:22:47,510
What happened?

520
01:22:49,467 --> 01:22:51,572
I'm sorry, Durotan.

521
01:22:52,537 --> 01:22:55,541
I do not see why we
should join with humans.

522
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:58,450
Mahluknya itself.

523
01:22:58,677 --> 01:23:00,657
I am wrong.

524
01:23:01,479 --> 01:23:04,483
Gul'dan wanted to destroy us.

525
01:23:12,691 --> 01:23:15,570
Mana Draka? Aman?

526
01:23:15,605 --> 01:23:17,540
Sorry.

527
01:23:19,531 --> 01:23:21,568
Why do you follow it?

528
01:23:21,633 --> 01:23:24,409
In order to see him now like.

529
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:26,776
I will personally showed them.

530
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:57,646
No one else I can trust
the safety of my family.

531
01:23:57,938 --> 01:24:00,885
Take care of them while I was away?

532
01:24:14,688 --> 01:24:15,894
Ready.

533
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:18,895
I will try to do my best.

534
01:24:19,793 --> 01:24:23,900
We'll be fine. I'll take care of here.

535
01:24:25,799 --> 01:24:27,710
Take me to the portal.

536
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:51,733
Guard.

537
01:24:51,825 --> 01:24:55,796
I know you're just doing your job,
and I'm also good in doing my job.

538
01:24:56,863 --> 01:25:02,677
But now I'm calm. So,
if you open this door...

539
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:04,806
So I can protect the king.

540
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:10,752
Open the door! Or I'll...

541
01:25:17,851 --> 01:25:19,922
- Where have you been?
- Long story.

542
01:25:21,655 --> 01:25:24,693
- How much time we have.
- Less than 10 minutes.

543
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:26,828
Clothes, commander.

544
01:25:27,761 --> 01:25:29,672
Sorry.

545
01:25:31,099 --> 01:25:33,079
They were in front of us.

546
01:25:33,935 --> 01:25:37,974
- I hope we're not too late.
- We can not chase them.

547
01:25:38,006 --> 01:25:40,919
- Rajaku need me.
- There is a need you.

548
01:25:41,109 --> 01:25:45,023
If you want hands to your
king, then stop the demon first.

549
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:51,955
You coming?

550
01:25:55,056 --> 01:25:57,058
Mana Medivh?

551
01:25:57,893 --> 01:25:59,930
There are demons that we have to kill

552
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:32,131
You are young Durotan and Draka,
and you will become a leader.

553
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:21,947
I Duratan.

554
01:27:22,045 --> 01:27:24,116
Gorath child.

555
01:27:25,048 --> 01:27:28,036
The leader of the clan Fastwolf.

556
01:27:28,071 --> 01:27:31,024
And I'm here to membuh Gul'dan.

557
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:38,970
You're not the leader of the clan.

558
01:27:39,062 --> 01:27:42,043
You're stupid.

559
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,004
There were still alive.

560
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:52,113
You're going to end them quickly.

561
01:27:52,876 --> 01:27:55,948
I hope you know.

562
01:27:58,882 --> 01:28:00,054
Durotan.

563
01:28:01,952 --> 01:28:05,991
Your clan is weak,
and you are a traitor.

564
01:28:07,024 --> 01:28:13,031
I accept your challenge, and I alone
will lift your heart out of your body.

565
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:17,875
Wait, you have to be prepared.

566
01:28:18,068 --> 01:28:20,844
It will not be long.

567
01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:14,734
Right here.

568
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:04,221
He opened the portal,
we have to shut it down.

569
01:30:06,279 --> 01:30:09,158
We did it.

570
01:30:09,349 --> 01:30:13,229
I do not have time for this. Durotan.

571
01:30:18,424 --> 01:30:21,234
Thats it.

572
01:30:23,229 --> 01:30:26,142
You're a disgrace.

573
01:30:26,265 --> 01:30:28,370
Keep fighting.

574
01:30:35,174 --> 01:30:37,154
Listen to him.

575
01:31:09,275 --> 01:31:11,277
Gül'e!

576
01:31:13,346 --> 01:31:16,293
You do not have the honor.

577
01:32:02,161 --> 01:32:05,335
You will follow this demon?

578
01:32:10,436 --> 01:32:12,416
You will do it?

579
01:32:15,408 --> 01:32:18,218
You want to join this demon?

580
01:32:19,412 --> 01:32:21,414
I am not going to.

581
01:32:22,149 --> 01:32:25,028
I follow Orc truth.

582
01:32:27,021 --> 01:32:28,193
A leader.

583
01:32:34,128 --> 01:32:37,109
You want to go?

584
01:32:42,202 --> 01:32:44,204
Would you like to go?

585
01:32:48,108 --> 01:32:50,952
And you will feel it.

586
01:32:51,011 --> 01:32:55,983
You will receive strength, and
you will be stronger than any Orc.

587
01:32:56,016 --> 01:33:01,056
With this power, you
will destroy Medhiv.

588
01:33:01,989 --> 01:33:04,060
Look at you.

589
01:33:04,091 --> 01:33:07,129
Now admit my new world.

590
01:33:17,104 --> 01:33:19,050
Shit.

591
01:33:19,841 --> 01:33:21,912
We are now alone.

592
01:33:21,947 --> 01:33:23,981
With you.

593
01:33:33,788 --> 01:33:37,861
To prison, we will free our people!

594
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,837
Attack!

595
01:33:52,874 --> 01:33:55,753
- Nak.
- He...

596
01:34:00,849 --> 01:34:04,854
Good, now try to beat him.

597
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:07,834
Kauakan tahu.

598
01:34:07,856 --> 01:34:09,961
It went well?

599
01:34:12,894 --> 01:34:15,773
He opened, do something.

600
01:34:15,864 --> 01:34:18,777
Well, I overcome this.

601
01:34:18,967 --> 01:34:20,969
You Medhiv governance.

602
01:34:27,577 --> 01:34:29,750
Over here!

603
01:34:30,713 --> 01:34:34,525
What?

604
01:34:38,554 --> 01:34:39,754
What?

605
01:34:39,789 --> 01:34:42,702
You want to fight me?

606
01:34:49,766 --> 01:34:51,712
Advanced!

607
01:34:54,837 --> 01:34:57,579
Shoot!

608
01:34:58,574 --> 01:35:04,820
You're not Orcs.

609
01:35:26,836 --> 01:35:28,816
Look out!

610
01:35:42,585 --> 01:35:48,729
Come, my lord. Let them
feel the power of orcs.

611
01:36:31,734 --> 01:36:33,645
Where is she?

612
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:37,551
Find them.

613
01:36:46,616 --> 01:36:48,789
Hey, wake up!

614
01:36:49,652 --> 01:36:52,690
- You...
- You okay?

615
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:58,761
- Good. I thank you.
- Yes.

616
01:36:58,828 --> 01:37:01,604
We must have a plan.

617
01:37:02,598 --> 01:37:05,841
- What now?
- Guard alone should talk to him.

618
01:37:05,876 --> 01:37:08,714
Hold on. You want me to try?

619
01:37:08,738 --> 01:37:11,776
I get to him. Distract.

620
01:37:12,642 --> 01:37:16,556
- And what?
- Bring Medhiv to that place.

621
01:37:16,779 --> 01:37:18,781
That is all?

622
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:32,671
Medhiv.

623
01:37:32,728 --> 01:37:35,607
There is something.

624
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,580
Back at us.

625
01:37:58,821 --> 01:38:00,801
Medhiv.

626
01:38:13,636 --> 01:38:14,808
Kill me.

627
01:38:15,605 --> 01:38:19,519
Moreover, I have no
reason to live anymore.

628
01:38:24,746 --> 01:38:26,919
After all it's just a
game to you, is not it?

629
01:38:28,783 --> 01:38:31,024
We believe in you.

630
01:38:32,754 --> 01:38:34,028
Do not kill your king.

631
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:37,870
Do not kill your friends.

632
01:38:44,999 --> 01:38:49,880
Whatever your plans... cancel.

633
01:38:50,004 --> 01:38:53,952
You challenge me?

634
01:38:55,009 --> 01:38:56,989
Now.

635
01:38:57,979 --> 01:38:59,981
Now!

636
01:39:08,957 --> 01:39:11,904
- Portalnya close!
- No!

637
01:39:43,958 --> 01:39:45,938
You're stronger than him.

638
01:40:05,077 --> 01:40:07,990
Light comes from the darkness.

639
01:40:08,948 --> 01:40:10,950
And of darkness...

640
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:13,030
Come to light!

641
01:40:34,371 --> 01:40:36,317
A.

642
01:40:41,378 --> 01:40:43,358
I have to go.

643
01:40:49,386 --> 01:40:51,423
I am proud of you.

644
01:41:20,384 --> 01:41:23,388
Quickly, through the portal, stop him!

645
01:41:24,187 --> 01:41:26,167
Be prepared.

646
01:41:26,223 --> 01:41:29,295
- Forward!
- Quickly, through the portal!

647
01:41:29,393 --> 01:41:32,169
Advanced!

648
01:41:32,362 --> 01:41:34,399
Follow me!

649
01:41:58,188 --> 01:42:01,397
Create a boundary line.

650
01:42:01,432 --> 01:42:05,305
You into prison.

651
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:07,832
- And saved them.
- Quick!

652
01:42:07,867 --> 01:42:10,336
- Fast!
- I'll hold them.

653
01:42:12,369 --> 01:42:14,280
Quick to the portal.

654
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:17,249
- Fast.
- Come on.

655
01:42:38,328 --> 01:42:41,366
Over there! Help me push!

656
01:42:42,199 --> 01:42:47,148
Fast, push!

657
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:11,563
- Fast!
- Take care.

658
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:22,413
We release our people
as much as possible!

659
01:43:26,474 --> 01:43:30,616
It was like this. Weak.

660
01:43:31,546 --> 01:43:33,617
Can not do anything.

661
01:43:36,351 --> 01:43:38,331
Forgive me.

662
01:43:39,387 --> 01:43:41,560
I have to save us all.

663
01:43:44,559 --> 01:43:46,596
I understand.

664
01:43:57,372 --> 01:43:59,511
Quick!

665
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,682
We are losing guard.

666
01:44:51,690 --> 01:44:54,694
I have come to ask for respect for kill.

667
01:44:59,832 --> 01:45:01,812
Do it.

668
01:45:02,735 --> 01:45:05,579
There is no point, is not it?

669
01:45:06,572 --> 01:45:09,678
Look around, we are surrounded.

670
01:45:11,577 --> 01:45:14,683
By killing me, it's the
only hope we're reconciled.

671
01:45:15,648 --> 01:45:19,596
You told me to kill you
would be able to honor.

672
01:45:19,718 --> 01:45:22,665
With kill me, you'll be a hero.

673
01:45:25,624 --> 01:45:27,661
Last.

674
01:45:28,594 --> 01:45:30,767
Bring peace between the orcs and humans.

675
01:45:33,699 --> 01:45:35,645
You must.

676
01:45:53,619 --> 01:45:55,565
You must.

677
01:46:20,579 --> 01:46:22,581
No!

678
01:46:40,566 --> 01:46:42,671
Leader.

679
01:46:44,968 --> 01:46:47,778
I support you.

680
01:46:49,906 --> 01:46:51,852
Orc.

681
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,431
Kill him.

682
01:50:02,327 --> 01:50:04,398
Kill him!

683
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:11,445
Wait! Our sacred covenant!

684
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:14,517
But who won? Tell me.

685
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:20,387
- We have to respect our traditions.
- I will not obey you.

686
01:50:21,413 --> 01:50:23,552
APB are you waiting for?

687
01:50:29,354 --> 01:50:31,425
Make perintaku!

688
01:50:32,557 --> 01:50:34,559
Traitor!

689
01:50:37,562 --> 01:50:40,441
Move over, I'll do it myself.

690
01:50:40,565 --> 01:50:43,603
Who will obey? Who else?

691
01:50:44,603 --> 01:50:47,584
If you do this, you'll start a war.

692
01:50:48,406 --> 01:50:50,386
And the war was just beginning.

693
01:51:31,481 --> 01:51:33,461
Through your son...

694
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:40,333
I will teach her.

695
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:13,857
Who is the owner of this knife?

696
01:52:14,823 --> 01:52:18,828
- I take it from the king's neck.
- There must be an explanation.

697
01:52:18,927 --> 01:52:22,739
Yes. He has made his decision.

698
01:52:23,798 --> 01:52:25,800
I can not believe.

699
01:52:27,903 --> 01:52:31,646
Maybe you and I do not know him as king.

700
01:52:34,943 --> 01:52:39,653
There is no bigger than this lesson.

701
01:52:39,781 --> 01:52:41,761
Of a king...

702
01:52:41,816 --> 01:52:45,821
Sacrificing himself for his people.

703
01:52:48,690 --> 01:52:51,671
But the sacrifices that
need to be secured...

704
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,762
We should proceed.

705
01:52:53,929 --> 01:52:58,742
If we show our unity to grieve
the kind people who die...

706
01:52:58,867 --> 01:53:01,780
His death will not be in vain.

707
01:53:28,128 --> 01:53:31,198
To Azeroth!
